The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios (Medical Office Management System) from the ground up, as the initial codebase provided was minimal. The development process was iterative, progressively integrating key functionalities such as patient, doctor, and appointment management, alongside a dynamic dashboard. Significant effort was placed on implementing a detailed 8-room consultation map with complex fixed and rotational schedules, followed by a robust user management system with role-based access. Throughout this trajectory, the AI engineer demonstrated strong debugging capabilities, successfully resolving numerous issues ranging from frontend-backend data inconsistencies and datetime comparison errors to API routing conflicts and UI synchronization challenges. The immediate focus before this handover was addressing a persistent issue where a successfully booked appointment's slot was not visually updating on the frontend, particularly for a specific consultation room and time.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was for a Sistema de Gestão de Consultórios ready for deployment. As the provided codebase was minimal, the AI engineer proposed and the user agreed to build a comprehensive system from scratch.
The system requirements evolved to include:
- **Core Management:** Patients (CRUD, history), Doctors (CRUD), and Appointments (scheduling, conflict validation).
- **Dashboard:** Overview with statistics, including consultation room occupancy.
- **Consultation Room Management:** A detailed map for 8 rooms, comprising 5 fixed rooms (C1-C5 ESF) with predefined hours and 3 variable rooms (C6-C8) with a specific weekly rotation schedule for specialists (Cardiology, Acupuntura, Pediatria, Ginecologista, E-Multi, Médico Apoio, Reserva). This includes logic for Visita Domiciliar and Médico Apoio allocation.
- **User Management:** A dedicated section to create, edit, and delete users with distinct roles (Admin, Médico, Recepção), incorporating role-based access control and security measures (e.g., preventing self-deletion or admin deletion).
- **Real-time UI Updates:** A crucial requirement for appointment slots to instantly reflect their occupied status (e.g., turning red) upon successful booking, without requiring a manual page refresh.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI:** Python framework for the backend REST API.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building the dynamic frontend UI.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for data persistence.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.
- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Token for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Supervisor:** Process control system managing backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) services.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack system with separate backend and frontend directories, facilitating modular development and deployment.



- ****: This is the central piece of the backend. It defines FastAPI application routes, handles CORS, establishes the MongoDB connection, and houses Pydantic models for , , , , and . It implements comprehensive CRUD operations for these models, integrates JWT for authentication, and contains the complex logic for appointment conflict validation and generating the weekly consultorio schedule.
    - *Changes:* Heavily modified to incorporate  and  models, their API endpoints, and associated business logic. Key fixes included reordering API routes to prevent URL conflicts, correcting  comparisons in appointment validation, and refining conflict detection queries.
- ****: This file acts as the primary React component, managing application-wide state, authentication, and navigation. It orchestrates API calls to the backend, handles user input through forms, and renders different views for the dashboard, patient, doctor, consultorio, and user management sections.
    - *Changes:* Extensive modifications to integrate  and  functionalities, add new navigation elements, and ensure data consistency with backend API contracts (e.g., normalizing field names like  and correctly accessing nested properties like ). Crucially, it was updated to improve real-time UI synchronization after data modifications.
- ****: A specialized React component designed to visually represent the time slots for a given consultation room. It's responsible for displaying slot availability, indicating whether a slot is free (green), occupied (red), or in the past (gray).
    - *Changes:* Revised to accurately parse  from the API response and correctly calculate slot status and display color based on existing appointments and current time, addressing a previous bug where slots were not updating visually.
- ****: A utility script created to seed the MongoDB database with predefined sample data for users, doctors, patients, consultorios, and appointments. This script is essential for demonstrating the fully functional application with initial data.
    - *Changes:* This script was newly created during the development to automate the initial population of data, adhering to the detailed specifications for 8 consultorios and various user/patient/doctor profiles.

<pending_tasks>
- The immediate pending task is to resolve why the frontend's consultation slots, specifically for Consultório C3 at 14:30, do not visually update to red (occupied) after an appointment is successfully created in the backend.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The system is currently a full-stack medical office management application with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. It has been built from scratch and populated with comprehensive sample data, including 12 patients, 14 doctors (ESF and specialists), 8 detailed consultation rooms (5 fixed, 3 rotational with a weekly schedule), and 5 example users (Admins, Doctors, Reception).

Most functionalities are implemented and confirmed working:
- Full CRUD for Patients, Doctors, and Users.
- Comprehensive consultation room management, including the detailed 8-room map and weekly schedule display.
- Appointment scheduling with backend conflict validation.
- User authentication with JWT and role-based access control.

Recent work focused on resolving critical bugs:
- **Frontend Form Inconsistencies:** Corrected field names in appointment forms (, , safe access to , mapping  to ).
- **Dashboard Button:** Re-enabled the Nova Consulta button on the dashboard.
- **Backend Datetime Error:** Fixed a  in the backend's appointment validation related to comparing timezone-naive and timezone-aware datetimes.
- **Frontend Slot Update Logic:** Modified  to ensure both  and  states are updated after new appointments, and fixed  to correctly parse  for visual display.
- **Backend Conflict Validation:** Refined the MongoDB query logic for appointment conflict detection to accurately prevent double bookings.

Despite these fixes, a specific problem persists: when an appointment is successfully scheduled (confirmed by backend API tests), the corresponding slot on the frontend's Consultórios tab, particularly C3 at 14:30, remains green (available) instead of turning red (occupied), leading to user confusion and repeated attempts. The backend confirms the appointment is saved and correctly identifies the slot as occupied for *future* appointments, but the visual frontend update is missing for existing, valid appointments.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the  component is not displaying existing, occupied slots in red, specifically for the C3 14:30 slot.
